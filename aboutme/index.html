				Oatmeal boxes, plastic bags, and pieces of string; I’ll make it work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Trash was by biggest ally as a Peace Corps Volunteer Teacher in a developing country. I’d use it to make visual aids for my lectures, interactive props for classwork, and decorations around the empty walls of the staff room. I still remember seeing that ah-ha moment in my students faces as they moved cardboard electrons between an Oxygen and Sodium made out of different colored plastic bags, understanding ionic bonding for the first time in three years.
			</p>

			<p>
				I apply the lessons I learned as a Volunteer to every problem I am trying to solve: that impossible is an opinion not a fact, persistence is a learned skilled, and that sometimes the resources you need are the ones you’ve taken for granted.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whether I’m building a team from a person of one, trying to scale an intricate internal process, or trying to get buy-in on an idea I have, I take a look at what I have available to me and figure out a way to make it work.
